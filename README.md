# 🏆 My First ERC-20 Token (in Foundry)

This repository contains a simple **ERC-20 token** implemented using **Foundry**, a fast and efficient smart contract development framework for Ethereum. It provides a minimal yet powerful setup to learn and experiment with ERC-20 token creation and deployment.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✔️ **ERC-20 Standard**: Implements a fully functional ERC-20 token  
- ✔️ **Testing with Foundry**: Includes unit tests to ensure contract correctness  
- ✔️ **Gas-efficient Implementation**: Optimized Solidity smart contract  

---

## 📌 Prerequisites  

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- **Foundry** (For smart contract development)  
- **Node.js & npm** (For interacting with the contract via scripts)  
- **MetaMask** or any Ethereum-compatible wallet  
- **Sepolia Testnet** or **Local Anvil instance** for deployment
